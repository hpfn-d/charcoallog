# charcoallog
Financial-accounting. Domestic use.

First project using Django. After saw Gileno's videos,<br>
but not all videos. And DjangoGirls tutorial too.

Will not be a new idea. I am using mymoneylog (github)<br>
to manager my bank account and want to change to a <br>
Python program.

TODO:<br>
- javascript to manager a selected period.
