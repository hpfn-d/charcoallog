# charcoallog
Financial-accounting. Domestic use.

First project using Django. After saw Gileno's videos,<br>
but not all videos. And DjangoGirls tutorial too. Trying<br>
to improve code after WTTD.

It is not a new idea. I am using mymoneylog (github)<br>
to manager my bank account and want to change to a <br>
Python program.

Transfer between accounts will not appear after a search<br>
(second form - only one field to fill and two dates to<br>
set) if category starts with 'transfer'. Unless you search<br>
for 'all'.

You can transfer between accounts like:  

 - description: account name to receive credit
 - category: 'transfer'
 - payment: account name which credit came from
